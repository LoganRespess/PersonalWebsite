# Source Code for my personal website I wanted to just get back into the swing of making websites and I thought it would probably be a good idea to start a website from good ole React.
This website will probably only contain a smaller blog that I would like to start writting and links to where I do other buisness.

### Dependencies
For this project I am going to be using React-Router-Dom and MUI for the front end. I'm not a fucking designer and I think Router-Dom will probably be the easiest way to build websites with multiple apages. Since I have quite a bit I like trying to do I think this will be the best bet.

### Colors

### Versions / Revisions
#### 0.0.1
I havent done shit yet. This is where were at with the very basic website. Once I get the barebones down I think we will move on.
